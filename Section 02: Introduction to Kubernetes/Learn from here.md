# Section 02 — Introduction to Kubernetes

This section gives you the big picture, then shows practical installation options so you can run Kubernetes locally.

## Who this is for
Anyone comfortable with basic Docker and terminal commands.

## Prerequisites
- Docker installed
- Laptop with ~2 vCPU and 4–8 GB RAM free for a local cluster

## Outcomes
By the end, you can:
- Explain what Kubernetes is and how it’s structured (control plane vs worker)
- Choose a local setup (minikube or kind) and know when to use each
- Install `kubectl` and connect it to your cluster

## How to use this section
1) Watch the videos below in order.  
2) Pick **one** local option (minikube or kind) and set it up.  
3) Run `kubectl get nodes` successfully.  
4) Do the reflection and self-check.

## Self-Reflection (post as a YouTube comment)

In 4–6 lines:

1. What’s one thing about **Kubernetes architecture** that finally clicked for you?
2. Which **local setup** did you choose (minikube or kind) and why?
3. What’s one **risk or limitation** of local clusters compared to production?
4. What do you want clarified before we start working with **Pods**?

## Self-Check

* [ ] I can describe the control plane vs worker nodes.
* [ ] I installed `kubectl` and connected to a local cluster.
* [ ] I can justify when I’d use minikube vs kind.
